With lots of trials in these two days, this website works finally. Since I am a newbie, I just take many things from other guys (Thanks!). This theme is mainly taken from Cyrille Rossant's &lt;a href="http://cyrille.rossant.net/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is modified from &lt;a href="https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme/pure-single"&gt;Pure&lt;/a&gt; theme. Although some small changes have been made from Rossant's, yet I wanna tweak it more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original reason why I made this blog is because I want to give some notes and hand out the homeworks as a TA of &lt;em&gt;General Physics(B)-II&lt;/em&gt; course this semester. Moreover, I had a php blog before, but I didn't use it for ages and also lost the password. So Why not a new one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I write the blogs in Markdown, but I wanna try reStructuredText to support LaTex equations. Maybe some plugins can help me even in Markdown. Moreover, I'd like to make IPython Notebook survive in this blog. I'll see what I can do. ^_^&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category></entry></feed>
