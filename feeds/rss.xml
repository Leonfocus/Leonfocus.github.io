With lots of trials in these two days, this website works finally. Since I am a newbie, I just take many things from other guys (Thanks!). This theme is mainly taken from &lt;a href="http://cyrille.rossant.net/"&gt;Cyrille Rossant's blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is modified from &lt;a href="https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme/pure-single"&gt;Pure&lt;/a&gt; theme. Although some small changes have been made from Rossant's, yet I wanna tweak it more later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original reason why I made this blog is because I want to give some notes and hand out the homeworks as a TA of &lt;em&gt;General Physics(B)-II&lt;/em&gt; course this semester. Moreover, I had a php blog before, but I didn't use it for ages and also lost the password. So Why not a new one? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I write the blogs in Markdown, but I wanna try reStructuredText to support LaTex equations. Maybe some plugins can help me even in Markdown. Moreover, I'd like to make IPython Notebook survive in this blog. I'll see what I can do. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Leon Chang</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-10-04:this-blog/</guid><category>pelican</category></item></channel></rss>
